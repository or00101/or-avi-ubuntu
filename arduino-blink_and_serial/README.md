# For linux-ubuntu:

open terminal and "cd" to this directory!

Then, install the Arduino Uno COM Port by typing in terminal:

> bash ubuntu-install.sh

This you do only once!


After that, whenever you want to run the script - type:

> python3 serial_blink.py <Board_name> <delay>


where <Board_name> is 'uno' for Arduino Uno, and <delay> is the number of sec's to delay the blinks.


# For Windows and Mac:

just run the code with:

> python3 serial_blink.py <Board_name> <delay>


where <Board_name> is 'uno' for Arduino Uno, and <delay> is the number of sec's to delay the blinks.
